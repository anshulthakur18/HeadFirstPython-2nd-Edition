REPL => Read-Eval-print-loop
Modules => Collection of related functions
Function are inside modules inside the standard library
Python comes with all the usual operators, including <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=, as well as the = assignment operator.
The in operator checks if one thing is inside another.
Python uses indentation to demarcate a block of code, which Python programmers prefer to call suite as opposed to block
elseif is replaced with keyword elif
Python comes with a built-in IDE called IDLE, which lets you create, edit, and run your Python code—all you need to do is type in your code, save it, and then press F5. 
IDLE interacts with the Python interpreter, which automates the compile-link-run process for you. This lets you concentrate on writing your code. 
The interpreter runs your code (stored in a file) from top to bottom, one line at a time. There is no notion of a main() function/method in Python. 
Python comes with a powerful standard library, which provides access to lots of reusable modules (of which datetime is just one example). 
There is a collection of standard data structures available to you when you’re writing Python programs. The list is one of them, and is very similar in notion to an array. 
The type of a variable does not need to be declared. When you assign a value to a variable in Python, it dynamically takes on the type of the data it refers to. 
You make decisions with the if/elif/else statement. The if, elif, and else keywords precede blocks of code, which are known in the Python world as “suites.” 
It is easy to spot suites of code, as they are always indented. Indentation is the only code grouping mechanism provided by Python. 
In addition to indentation, suites of code are also preceded by a colon (:). This is a syntactical requirement of the language.
