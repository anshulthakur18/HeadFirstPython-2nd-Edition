1. REPL => Read-Eval-print-loop

2. Modules => Collection of related functions

3. **Functions**  
  Functions are inside modules inside the standard library.

4. **Operators**  
  Python comes with all the usual operators, including `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`, as well as the `=` assignment operator.

5. **Membership Operator**  
  The `in` operator checks if one thing is inside another.

6. **Code Blocks**  
  Python uses indentation to demarcate a block of code, which Python programmers prefer to call a suite as opposed to a block.

7. **Conditional Statements**  
  `elseif` is replaced with the keyword `elif`.

8. **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**  
  Python comes with a built-in IDE called IDLE, which lets you create, edit, and run your Python code—all you need to do is type in your code, save it, and then press `F5`.

9. **Interpreter**  
  IDLE interacts with the Python interpreter, which automates the compile-link-run process for you. This lets you concentrate on writing your code.

10. **Execution Flow**  
   The interpreter runs your code (stored in a file) from top to bottom, one line at a time. There is no notion of a `main()` function/method in Python.

11. **Standard Library**  
   Python comes with a powerful standard library, which provides access to lots of reusable modules (of which `datetime` is just one example).

12. **Data Structures**  
   There is a collection of standard data structures available to you when you’re writing Python programs. The `list` is one of them, and is very similar in notion to an array.

13. **Dynamic Typing**  
   The type of a variable does not need to be declared. When you assign a value to a variable in Python, it dynamically takes on the type of the data it refers to.

14. **Decision Making**  
   You make decisions with the `if`/`elif`/`else` statement. The `if`, `elif`, and `else` keywords precede blocks of code, which are known in the Python world as “suites.”

15. **Indentation**  
   It is easy to spot suites of code, as they are always indented. Indentation is the only code grouping mechanism provided by Python.

16. **Colons in Syntax**  
   In addition to indentation, suites of code are also preceded by a colon (`:`). This is a syntactical requirement of the language.

17. Python is a versatile and beginner-friendly programming language.
